The question asks that you find a hypothesis that minimizes the in-sample sum of deviations and then show that your estimate will be the in-sample median. You skipped the first part, which requires you to minimize the in-sample error and construct a hypothesis and instead attempted only the second portion. The main issue in this proof is in the second-to-last paragraph. You make claims about how the two terms in your expressions for E_in differ between your different cases for h_med. You fail to support these claims rigorously. Since the h_med is different in each expression, each individual difference in both summations will be different between cases, so it's hard to know how they differ. Rather than analytically show in mathematics how these cases differ, you provided a general but lacking explanation as to how they differ in one respect. While it's good to explain your evidence in words, you also need math to back it up. 

The proof can be done in a way similar to your reasoning here, but dealing with the way the absolute deviations change as h_med changes is difficult. A more straight-forward way to tackle this proof would be to rely on the fact that functional minima occur where the first derivative is zero and the second derivative is positive. Taking the derivative of E_in with respect to h and setting that equal to zero can reveal a motivation for choosing the minimizing hypothesis.
